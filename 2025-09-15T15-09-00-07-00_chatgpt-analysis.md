## Context
- Command observed: `cm mv /Users/tryk/nabia/chats/auras/igris /Users/tryk/leGen/auras/igris --dry-run`
- Timestamp (America/Los_Angeles): 2025-09-15T15:09:00-07:00

## What happened
- The `cm` wrapper started its hardened move workflow: normalize inputs, pre-flight validation, then scanned for running Claude processes.
- It detected 7 active Claude processes and prompted for confirmation; the user continued (`y`).
- During the session scanning phase the script hit `/Users/tryk/.local/bin/cm: line 745: [[: 0
0: arithmetic syntax error in expression (error token is "0")`.
- Despite the error it still produced an operation plan, showing the source, destination, associated Claude project path migration, and counts (`7 files` / `1743 cwd occurrences`) before prompting to proceed with the move.

## Working theory on the failure
- The failing branch uses `[[ ... ]]` (or possibly `(( ... ))`) for an arithmetic comparison on a variable that unexpectedly contains `"0\n0"` or multiple tokens. That leads to the arithmetic syntax error when Bash evaluates the expression, so the script never records whatever condition the check was supposed to gate.
- The extra `0` token likely comes from parsing a command output that returns two columns (e.g., a count and filename) or from a newline that was not stripped. This would be consistent with a loop counting matching sessions/CWD entries during the scan step.
- Because the scan continues after the error, downstream logic probably ignores the failed check; an actual (non-dry-run) move might still execute but with the same warning on every run.

## Recommended follow-ups for whoever picks this up
1. Inspect `/Users/tryk/.local/bin/cm` around line 745 to see which count variable feeds the comparison and ensure it trims whitespace (`$(...)` with `tr -d '[:space:]'` or use `mapfile`/`read -r`).
2. Re-run the dry-run after instrumenting that section (e.g., add a temporary `echo "session_count='$session_count'" >&2`) to confirm the offending value.
3. Validate whether the arithmetic gate is important (it might prevent proceeding when scans find nothing); ensure the logic still succeeds once the count parsing is fixed.
4. Double-check that moving with active Claude processes is safe; if not, consider terminating or letting the tool abort rather than continuing after the warning.
